     <b>page <sup>1 </sup></b> <br>
     <p>A quiet hour steals the afternoon,<hr>
<strong>The sun hangs low,</strong> a coin of <em>faded</em> gold.
And <i>all</i> the scattered thoughts, like dust,
Begin to settle in the silent % cold.
I watch the shadows stretch and reach and thin,
And see the years in patterns on the floor.
A younger ghost plays games where I have been,
And finds a memory behind each door.
The clock'<sub>s</sub> soft ticking is a gentle hand,
That marks the passing, &nbsp; not with sound or fuss,<br>
But with a slow and patient-held command,
To leave behind <abbr title="">the former shape of us.</abbr>
And so I write, while autumn's colors burn, <blockquote>A different leaf on each remembered year.</blockquote>
To hold the moment, watch the <q>pages</q> turn,
And find the quiet poetry of here.</p>
<p>hello
